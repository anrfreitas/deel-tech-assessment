# DEEL BACKEND TASK

ðŸ’« Welcome! ðŸŽ‰

This backend exercise involves building a Node.js/Express.js app that will serve a REST API. We imagine you should spend around 3 hours at implement this feature.

You can find the original `README.md` in resources folder. There's also a Postman collection related to every endpoint in this project.

## Achievements
- All endpoints were implemented
- Implemented caching strategy using Node-Cache
- Implemented Adapters, Helpers and a way to Abstract Routes
- Some simple unit tests, and a very simple example of integration tests

### What would I have done more?
- Implement remaining Unit and Integration Tests where it's applicable

- Add Pagination on `/contracts` and where else it's applicable

- Add Rate limiting where it's applicable

- Add a queue system and plug it in that endpoint `/jobs/:job_id/pay` making it being processed by it, it'd be an extra step to work with concurrency (optimistic lock) making sure things go smoothly on heavy write process, mitigating any risk we might have in the future
    - And adding a notification system to notify the user the payment has been done successfully done or failed
    - Also, would be nice to have a transactions table to store the operation and its statusses

- Add Swagger to help our developers understand our endpoints

- Add Observability System to check our Microservice Health (Eg. Prometheus, Grafana, Cloudwatch)

- Add Logging System (Eg. [Sentry](https://sentry.io/))

- Setup Typescript + EsLint + Prettier + Husky to make sure the code looks nice

- Setup Github Actions or AWS CodePipeline to perform CI/CD to staging / production servers

## Getting Set Up

The exercise requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed. We recommend using the LTS version.

1. Start by creating a local repository for this folder.

1. In the repo root directory, run `npm install` to gather all dependencies.

1. Next, `npm run seed` will seed the local SQLite database. **Warning: This will drop the database if it exists**. The database lives in a local file `database.sqlite3`.

1. Then run `npm start` which should start both the server and the React client.

## Technical Notes

- The server is running with [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) which will automatically restart for you when you modify and save a file.

- The database provider is SQLite, which will store data in a file local to your repository called `database.sqlite3`. The ORM [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) is on top of it. You should only have to interact with Sequelize - **please spend some time reading sequelize documentation before starting the exercise.**

- To authenticate users use the `getProfile` middleware that is located under src/middleware/getProfile.js. users are authenticated by passing `profile_id` in the request header. after a user is authenticated his profile will be available under `req.profile`. make sure only users that are on the contract can access their contracts.

- The server is running on port 3001.

## Running Tests

- To run the projects unit tests is very simple, you just need to run `npm run test` on root directory

- If you want to run integration tests, you gotta first seed our local database by running `npm run seed` and then `npm run test:integration`

- Test patterns:
    - Integration tests: `*.test.js`
    - Unit tests: `*.spec.js`
